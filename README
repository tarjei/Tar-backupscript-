This is a simple fork of the backupscript found here: 
http://www.joescat.com/backup/

Usage:
you can either modify the config values within the script - or create a separate config file.

Then the script may be called with the path to the config file as its second parameter:
./backup-incremental.sh  ./config.sh



Changes: 
1. extracted config to separate file
2. changed sh to bash
3. Modified the way dirs are defined
